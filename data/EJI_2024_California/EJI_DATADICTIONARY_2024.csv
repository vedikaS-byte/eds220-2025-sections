Variables beginning with ""E_"" are estimates. Variables beginning with ""EPL"" are percentile ranks for those estimates. 
Variables beginning with ""SPL_"" are summed indicator or module ranks for domains, modules, or overall scores, and variables beginning with ""RPL_"" are percentile ranks for domains, modules, or overall scores. 
Values of -999 represent ""null"" or ""no data"".
